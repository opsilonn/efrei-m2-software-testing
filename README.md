## All you need to know

### Where to find the project
Here is the Github repository :
 ```
https://github.com/opsilonn/efrei-m2-software-testing
 ```


### The project's concept
The goal of this project is to make a Proof Of Concept of a migration from a Java desktop application to a web-browser with a sucessful data migration, built around a data plan.


### Getting Started
The programmation is fully completed, but you still have to both configure 3 parts of the project.
Don't worry ! We've got you covered.

```
 DATABASE :
   Using XAMP ou WAMP, import the script 'edg.sql' that can be found at the root of the project.
   
 
 BACK-END :
  Create a copy of the file 'hibernate-template.cfg.xml' that can be found here : '/back-end\prototype\src\main\resources'.
  Rename it 'hibernate.cfg.xml', and rename the following parameters according to your configuration :
    - connection.username
    - connection.password, if you have any
    - connection.url, if you use a port different to 3306
   
   Then go to the folder back-end and open the windows powershell or windows command line, and run the following command:
   $mvn spring-boot:run

 
 FRONT-END :
  Create a copy of the file 'server/local.server.config.example.js'
  rename it 'server/local.server.config.js'

  To download the dependencies, open a console tab and enter :
  $npm install
  
  To make the server operational, please enter :
  $npm run dev
```


## Advanced presentation
This project of Software Testing aims to simulate the many activites the company EDG wants to launch to reach more clients. Among them are a chat-box, a mobile application on both IOS and Android, a web portal... 
Here, we'll focus on a simple POC of a web portal that is able to create and modify data, whether a user or a contract.

### Requirements
We want to create or modify a user.
A contract cannot be created if no user is selected.
All inputs for both users and contracts must be valid (ex : no empty value, no negative number, all dates must be valid and existing...)
The interface must be responsive as well as intuitive.



### RoadMap
* Phase 1 : configuration
  * Assign tasks
  * Draw requirements
  * Rethink the database
  * Configure the web app'
* Phase 2 : account display
  * API : CRUD
  * Front : CRUD


### Prototype
The prototype is a Proof-Of-Concept to show that we are able to develop a website linked to a backend server that is able to create and modify a user or a contract.




## Technical round-up
The whole project was made using :
